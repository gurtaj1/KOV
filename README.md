The task with this app, was to Develop the Front-End for an eCommerce website.

I found that ReactJS worked really well for cutting out large amounts of repetetive work. All of the product lists, and individual product pages were essentially just the same components but with different props. I utilised React-Redux to store all the information on the products, to allow for the ability to filter by product types, and to search through products using keywords. I also used React-Router to set a path for each page.
